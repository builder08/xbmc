    <description lang="en">Simply use this scraper to add any videos ( home videos, and other) to their library without having to use nfo files with the filename of the movie. IMPORTANT: If you do not know this - setting the scraper and running an (automated) scan does NOT pick up changes you make to nfo files you put - it took a long time to 'get that' so I thought it was important to reiterate. To refresh your library eithr rename your files and re-run or set the 'this directory contains' parameter to none, click OK, then reset the values back to movie and rescrape. I learned how to do all this by editing the themoviedB.org scraper so thank you for your excellent example.</description>
