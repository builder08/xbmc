\section Python_Visualisation_addon_section2 Tools

Visualisations are quite complicated so you probably want to have a graphics
editing package such as GIMP (https://www.gimp.org) installed for when you need
to resize or crop textures or image backgrounds.

Video editing software may also be useful but that is beyond the scope of this
tutorial.

\section Python_Visualisation_addon_section3 Installing

Since we don't have a full "HOW TO" guide for this yet (please feel free to sign
up to the wiki and edit this page) we will just show some source code of other
visulisations for now.

- https://github.com/vdb86/screensaver.digitalclock
- https://github.com/wsnipex/visualization.projectm

You can either download as a zip and install both of these inside the kodi GUI
from the install from zip feature. Or extract the zip into your userdata/add-ons
folder.
