\section Add_on_Rules_sect1 Repository Submission Guidelines - Please Read Before Submitting Your Addon

Because maintaining such a large repository is a large task, we have set some
guidelines for inclusion. Please ensure that these guidelines are met before
submitting request to be added. In order to be considered for the official
repository, the following guidelines must be met:

- All add-ons must be developed as described on the
  [Add-on development](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_development) page.
- You must include a license file (named LICENSE.txt). We recommend the
  [CC-BY-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/choose/non-web-popup?license_code=by-sa&jurisdiction=&version=3.0&lang=en) for
  skins and the [GPL v2+](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html) for others,
  but most copy left licenses will suffice.
  Please investigate which license suits your needs and you fully understand the
  contents.
- All files must be free and legal to distribute.
- The add-on must not violate any known copyright laws - if in doubt, let us know
  and we'll look into it for you.
- All source files must be included. No pre-compiled files will be allowed.
- You acknowledge that you are the maintainer of your add-on.
- Team-Kodi reserves the right to update or remove it at any time as we deem
  necessary.
- If a new stable Kodi is going to be released no new submissions are accepted to
  the repository for the previous version. This will start from when the first
  [release candidate (RC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_candidate#Release_candidate)
  of the new version is released. Only fixes and updates
  will be accepted and processed for the previous version (e.g. if the current
  stable is 13.x, no updates are allowed for 11.x any more).
  [Allowed submissions](http://kodi.wiki/view/Submitting_Add-ons#Allowed_submissions)
- Monetization of add-ons (for instance advertising or paid subscriptions) will
  not be allowed. We can make an exception in case you own the copyright for the
  content the addon provides. Please contact us on the add-on mailing list if
  you believe such an exception may apply to your addon.
- All xbmc.python.module addons must be used by at least one other add-on in
  official repository.

\section Add_on_Rules_sect2 Updates

Keep in mind that add-ons in the official repository should be considered stable.
This means that they should be well-tested before you submit them for inclusion.
Because they are for stable users, they should avoid being updated too often. Too
 often is of course subjective. If your add-on is in rapid development, and
 features are constantly being added, hold off until you have hit a good stopping
 point and tested the current version.

This means that you should not submit a request every time you change your code.
If you are submitting updates more than once per week something is wrong. Once
or twice per month is probably a better goal, barring unforeseen conditions (like
a content source changing its paths). With good reasons provided we will of course
make exceptions as we strive to prove the best user experience.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section Add_on_Rules_sect3 General requirements

Here's a list of what basic sanity checks are done by repository maintainer on
each submission.

__Basic file checks:__
- all strings used by add-ons must be localized, no hard-coded language
  strings should ever be used
- all paths should be treated as case-sensitive, so that they work on
  all OSs and file systems.
- all paths and files should be lower-case due to the previous point
  - exceptions are README, COPYING, LICENSE.txt that should be upper-case and the
    "Default" directory in <c>resources/skins</c>, for add-ons that need it.
- exception are the translation Language folders with should be first letter capitalised.
- the following file-types are not allowed: <c>.so .dll .pyo .exe .xbt .xpr Thumbs.db</c>
  and so on<any binary files>
- all text files should use UNIX end-of-line
- all <c>.xml</c> files must pass xml validation
- all <c>.xml</c> files must have xml declaration as header
- all <c>.xml/.txt</c> must have unix style EOL's
- don't use a BOM at the start of your files
- file permissions: files should not be marked as executable
- filenames must have correct encoding (for skins: check your studio logos
  for corrupt filenames)

__Things that must be included:__
- [<c>addon.xml</c>](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_structure#addon.xml) must contain correct and valid info / version
- [<c>icon.png</c>](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_structure#icon.png) must be present (256x256)
- [<c>fanart.jpg</c>](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_structure#fanart.jpg) must be present (1280x720 or 1920x1080)
- [<c>LICENCE.txt</c>](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_structure#LICENSE.txt) must be present
- [<c>changelog.txt</c>](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_structure#changelog.txt) must be present
- start with last changes at top of the file
See also: [Add-on_structure](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_structure)

__Things that can't be included:__
- no .xbt files (these will be generated by our repository)
- no other add-ons included (skinners: if you need a script, submit it separately
  and depend on it)
- don't include unneeded files (.pdf, .doc, thumbs.db, etc...)
- no licensed fonts / background images / anything

\subsection Add_on_Rules_sect3_1 Requirements for skins

__Basic checks:__
- The file size must be sane. There is no hard limit, but a 100mb skin is pushing it.
- No mods. Mods are great, and pop up frequently in the forums. But they are only
  confusing to non-forum-goers. This can be vague, each is evaluated on its own merit.
  By naming your "mod" different and make it substantial different enough, we will
  of course take it in consideration.
- Due to a bug in TexturePacker, all graphics files should have a resolution of at
  least 4x4.
- Themes must be in a subfolder of the themes/ folder in the skin root (e.g.
  <c>skin.foo/themes/blue/<files></c>). The <c>.xbt</c> file will be created by our
  repo backend.
- If you want to have some images outside of Textures.xbt, then make sure you
  place those images outside of the media/ folder and reference them using
  <c>special://skin/backdrops/*</c> or similar. This is most useful for
  backgrounds - it keeps the size of the packed textures down. Any images you have
  in the media/ folder will be placed in Textures.xbt in the official repository.
- Please be careful with addon dependencies. Only add dependencies that are needed
  for the skin to function properly.

__Things that must be included:__
- _screenshots folder must be present, containing max. 10 .jpg screenshots (1280x720) with a reasonable file size.

__Code checks:__
- all labels must be localized
- code should be case-sensitive
- skins should not create warning/errors in the logfile, this can be a lot of things:
  - invalid includes
  - undefined actions
  - unable to evaluate condition
  - undefined vars
  - can't focus 'id'

@note This of course also applies to script add-ons that use skin files

\subsection Add_on_Rules_sect3_2 Optional support
This is optional and should not block inclusion in official repo.

- mouse support
- touchscreen support
- peripheral dialogs
- PVR support
- ADSP support
- RDS support


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section Add_on_Rules_sect4 Requirements for scripts and plugins

- all <c>special://</c> paths should be translated using <c>xbmc.translatePath("special://foo/bar")</c>
- <c>xbmc.translatePath(xbmcaddon.Addon().getAddonInfo('path')).decode('utf-8')</c> should
  be used for files included with the add-on
- <c>xbmc.translatePath(xbmcaddon.Addon().getAddonInfo('profile')).decode('utf-8')</c>
  should be used for storing add-on related files
- direct access to the Kodi database is not allowed.
  You must use [JSON RPC](http://kodi.wiki/view/JSON_RPC) for this.
- directly using analytics (Google Analytics for example) from within add-ons is
  not allowed. This should be handled server side by using user-agent.
- add-ons should store all their data in their own subfolder inside the addon_data
  directory. Access (read/write/delete) to any other files in settings folders is
  not allowed. Access (read/write/delete) to other all other files/directories must
  be opt-in by the user, and be clear for the user to understand what is being
  accessed. *Exceptions to this rule may be granted in specific cases only.
  Please contact Team XBMC's add-on repository maintainers via the add-on mailing
  list if your add-on needs access to such files.*

__Things that shouldn't be included:__
- _screenshots folder (only in remote cases it could have some added value)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section Add_on_Rules_sect5 Requirements for scrapers
- scraper must return the following minimum information: movie title, year, plot,
  cast, poster, fanart
- use 'chain function' for calling functions in common scrapers
- remove the deprecated XML tags from the scraper header in case you use a scraper
  editor made for pre-Dharma versions of XBMC
